The earliest	documented encounter with Native people occurred in 1513 when Ponce de Leon,	who colonized Puerto Rico, sailed north to the peninsula that is now Florida.	As a preemptive strike against the French who were exploring to the north, the	Spanish made several attempts at colonization. They established the first settlement	of St. Augustine in what is now Florida in 1565. In what is today New Mexico, a	large group of settlers drove out the	<A href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('g_pueblo.html','glossary','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=300,height=250'); return false">Pueblo</A>	people in 1598 to establish a	Spanish colony. By 1610, the Spanish established their capital in Santa Fe, which	they maintained until 1680 when the pueblo	people revolted and in turn, drove the	Spanish out. Fourteen years later the Spanish regained control.</P><P><B>French Exploration</B>		<BR>At the same time that the Spanish were exploring the southern regions of the continent,	the French established themselves in the Northeast, capitalizing on the abundant	variety of fish, and establishing a lucrative fur trade with Native people of the	Woodlands area. The French reached the Great Lakes by 1623. During the early 1700s,	they pushed south from their settlements in Canada to the interior of the continent.	Even though this land had been home to Native people for thousands of years, the	French were able to establish dominion in the area from Minnesota to the Gulf of	Mexico, which they named Louisiana after their king, Louis XIV.</P><P><B>The English and the Dutch</B>		<BR>Along the Atlantic seaboard, the English and the Dutch joined in competition for	the land of the New World. Before the end of the 16th century, the English had	attempted to establish colonies on Roanoke Island off the coast of North Carolina.	The first permanent English settlement was to the north at Jamestown, Virginia in	1607. Two years later, the Dutch founded the colony of New Amsterdam (today's New	York). It was here that the infamous trade occurred in which the Dutch acquired	Manhattan Island for goods that were valued at $24 at that time. By the time the	pilgrims settled at Plymouth Colony (Massachusetts) in 1620, the Native people held	deep resentments against white settlers. Despite these hard feelings, Samoset, a	Pemaquid chief, greeted the colonists in English and gave assistance to the newcomers.	In 1625, the first deed transferring land from the American Indians to the Europeans	was recorded. Samoset did not consider deeds important, unable to foresee the	consequences of the European idea of exclusive land rights. Samoset, like other Native	people, believed that the land belonged to everyone.</P><P><B>The Impact of Europeans</B>		<BR>The three centuries that followed the early exploration and settlement of North America	by Europeans witnessed the transformation of American Indians from free people who	populated the entire continent to a vastly reduced numbers confined to reservations.	In the beginning European colonists often reported encounters with Native people who	were friendly and helpful to them. But Native people stood in the way of what colonists	wanted. The motivation of European&#45;Americans, which was the acquisition of land, was	always in direct opposition to the desire of the Native people to live lightly on the	earth in accordance with their own traditions. In many instances Native people were	simply crowded out of their lands. When it was necessary to forcibly remove them, they	were forcibly removed. Some Native people were used as unpaid laborers while others	were kidnapped and sold into the slave trade. European diseases, for which Native	people had no immunity, wiped out entire populations in many areas. By the middle of the	19th century, the Native population was reduced by one&#45;half to two&#45;thirds its size two	hundred years earlier.</P><P>		<SPAN class="link">More about <A href="history_culture5.html">Native American History and Culture</A></SPAN>		<BR>		<BR>		<BR></P></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD>&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">	<TR>		<TD colspan="3" valign="top" height="1" background="images/black_dot.gif">		<IMG src="images/black_dot.gif"></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD width="90" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsmia.org">		<IMG src="images/logo.gif" width="90" height="60" alt="MIA Home Page" align="middle" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD width="160" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsconnected.org">		<IMG src="images/logo_aceonly.gif" width="160" height="25" alt="ArtsConnectEd" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD valign="top" align="right" width="504"><A href="print_curriculum.html"><IMG src="images/printable.gif" width="185" height="19" alt="Printable Curriculum" border="0"></A></TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
