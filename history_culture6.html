Lives of both American Indians and Euro&#45;Americans were lost, families	were displaced, and treaties were made and broken. In the view of the government, the	ultimate solution in the West, as had already occurred in the East, was to confine the	Indians to reservations. Reservations are areas of usually very poor lands with specific	boundaries, to which specific tribes were assigned to live. The assignments were made	with little sensitivity. Tribes that were traditional enemies were sometimes placed	together on a single reservation.</P><P>In an attempt to control the Plains Indians, the U.S. government encouraged the	slaughter of the wild buffalo, the primary food source of the Native people. Once	exterminated, the government believed that the Indians would have no choice but to	willingly move on the reservations where they would receive food rations. Eventually,	that assumption proved to be correct, but not before the Plains people waged a valiant fight.</P></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD valign="top" width="6%">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD valign="top" width="66%">			<TABLE width="318" cellspacing="6" cellpadding="6" align="right" border="0">				<TR>					<TD valign="top" align="left" width="310"><BR><P class="caption2"><A href="#"				onClick="MM_openBrWindow('http://zoom.artsconnected.org/fif=mia/fpx/09/mia_9709b.fpx&obj=uv,1.0&wid=320&hei=240&page=uv_page6.html','zoom','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=440,height=350'); return false">		<IMG src="images/big_horn.jpg" title="big_horn" width="310" height="162" align="top" alt="One Bull; Hunkpapa Lakota, Custer's War, about 1900, The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, The Christina N. and Swan J.

The Black Hills was a sacred place to the Lakota people.	The struggle for the Black Hills culminated in 1876 at the Battle of Little Bighorn where	the combined forces of several Sioux tribes defeated General George Custer and the U.S.	Army's 7th Cavalry. Although the Lakota won, the Army pursued them relentlessly, and	ultimately their ability to resist was diminished by the extermination of the buffalo.	The last Sioux bands were confined to reservations in 1878.</P><P>The Ghost Dance, which spread to the Plains from Nevada, prophesied the return of the	buffalo and the disappearance of the white people. The Ghost Dance movement was viewed by	many Native people as a &quot;last chance&quot; for the return of their old way of life, but the U.S.	government viewed the movement as another threat. In the final episode of Indian wars,	the U.S. Cavalry massacred defenseless men, women, and children of a starving Sioux band	at Wounded Knee, South Dakota &#45; an act that was rewarded by Congressional Medals of Honor	for the Cavalry soldiers. The dispute over the Black Hills did not, however, end at	Wounded Knee. Currently it is being fought in the courts rather than on the battlefield.</P><P>		<SPAN class="link">More about <A href="history_culture7.html">Native American History and Culture</A></SPAN>		<BR>		<BR>		<BR></P></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD>&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">	<TR>		<TD colspan="3" valign="top" height="1" background="images/black_dot.gif">		<IMG src="images/black_dot.gif"></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD width="90" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsmia.org">		<IMG src="images/logo.gif" width="90" height="60" alt="MIA Home Page" align="middle" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD width="160" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsconnected.org">		<IMG src="images/logo_aceonly.gif" width="160" height="25" alt="ArtsConnectEd" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD valign="top" align="right" width="504"><A href="print_curriculum.html"><IMG src="images/printable.gif" width="185" height="19" alt="Printable Curriculum" border="0"></A></TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
