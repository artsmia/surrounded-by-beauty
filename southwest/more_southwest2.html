They		introduced horses as well as livestock (sheep and cattle) and fruit orchards to the area. They		also exploited the native people by using them as unpaid laborers, imposing different cultural		practices on them, and encroaching on their lands. This resulted in a revolt in 1680, when the		native Pueblo people drove out the Spanish, who did not regain control until 1694. From that time		on, the Southwest was under the control of first Spain, then Mexico, and eventually the United		States.</P>      <P align="left">Through a combination of epidemic disease and the impact         of Spanish control, Pueblo populations were reduced by two&#45;thirds within         two centuries following the arrival of the Spanish. The Din&eacute; (Navajo),         who had assimilated some aspects of the Pueblo culture and depended upon         them for trade, were eventually driven north by incoming settlers and         forced to resort to raiding in order to survive. As more white settlers         from the east arrived in the 19th century, the U.S. government took steps         to halt the raiding. Under the leadership of Kit Carson, the army destroyed         Din&eacute; crops and livestock, forcing the people to surrender. The Din&eacute; were         imprisoned on a barren reservation at Bosque Redondo in New Mexico. Five         years later, the Din&eacute; were reduced to such a small number that they no         longer posed a threat and were consequently allowed to return to their         homeland, which by then was surrounded by white settlements. Despite this         history of oppression, the Din&eacute; nation is one of the largest of         all American Indian nations today, numbering over 100,000 people.</P><P align="left"><B class="head">The Southwest Today</B>		<BR>Although the culture of the people of the Southwest was vastly disrupted by the arrival of		Europeans, they have managed to retain many of the artistic traditions of their ancestors and to		develop new skills. Pueblo potters of the Southwest initiated a revival of pottery in the early		20th century. Many contemporary Pueblo potters continue to make their pottery by the ancient		<A href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('../g_coiling.html','glossary','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=300,height=250'); return false">coiling</A>		method. The weaving techniques of Din&eacute; women are largely unchanged since they learned		the art from the Pueblo men centuries ago. From the earliest times, Din&eacute; people made jewelry		from natural materials. After they learned silversmithing from Mexican artisans, they began to		produce silver jewelry. A'shiwi (Zuni) and Hopituh (Hopi) artists learned the skill from Din&eacute; smiths. Native		American artists of the Southwest today continue to create the arts for which they are famous.</P><P align="left"><B class="head">Tribal Web Sites</B>		<BR>Navajo tribal web site: <A href="http://www.navajo-nsn.gov/" class="link">http://www.navajo-nsn.gov/</A>		<BR>Hopi tribal web site: <A href="http://www.hopi-nsn.gov/" class="link">http://www.hopi-nsn.gov/</A></P><P>&nbsp;</P></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD height="25">&nbsp;</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD valign="top" width="6%" height="1"></TD>		<TD colspan="2" valign="top" background="../images/black_dot.gif" height="1" width="450">		<IMG src="../images/black_dot.gif"></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD valign="top">&nbsp;</TD>		<TD colspan="2" valign="top">		<TABLE border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="457">			<TR align="center">				          <TD><A href="acoma_home.html"><IMG src="images/sw_icon_acoma_c.gif" width="60" height="58" border="0" alt="Acoma Jar"></A></TD>				<TD><A href="martinez_home.html"><IMG src="images/sw_icon_martinez_c.gif" width="60" height="58" border="0" alt="Martinez Pot"></A></TD>				<TD><A href="dinebracelet_home.html"><IMG src="images/sw_icon_dinebracelet_c.gif" width="60" height="53" border="0" alt="Din&eacute; Bracelet"></A></TD>				<TD><A href="zuni_home.html"><IMG src="images/sw_icon_zuni_c.gif" width="60" height="53" border="0" alt="Zuni Bracelet"></A></TD>				<TD><A href="pima_home.html"><IMG src="images/sw_icon_pima_c.gif" width="60" height="43" border="0" alt="Pima Basket"></A></TD>				<TD><A href="oodham_home.html"><IMG src="images/sw_icon_oodham_c.gif" width="60" height="56" border="0" alt="Tohono O'odham Basket"></A></TD>				<TD><A href="dinebasket_home.html"><IMG src="images/sw_icon_dinebasket_c.gif" width="60" height="54" border="0" alt="Din&eacute; Wedding Basket"></A></TD>				<TD align="center"><A href="../history_culture.html"><IMG src="images/hist_cult.gif" width="105" height="26" border="0" alt="Native Amercan History and Culture"></A></TD>			</TR>		</TABLE><P>&nbsp;</P></TD>	</TR></TABLE><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">	<TR>		<TD colspan="3" valign="top" height="1" background="../images/black_dot.gif">		<IMG src="../images/black_dot.gif"></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD width="90" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsmia.org">		<IMG src="../images/logo.gif" width="90" height="60" alt="MIA Home Page" align="middle" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD width="160" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsconnected.org">		<IMG src="../images/logo_aceonly.gif" width="160" height="25" alt="ArtsConnectEd" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD valign="top" align="right" width="504"><A href="../print_curriculum.html"><IMG src="../images/printable.gif" width="185" height="19" alt="Printable Curriculum" border="0"></A></TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
