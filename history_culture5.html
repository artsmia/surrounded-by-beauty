Even though the U.S. government theoretically protected the rights of the	Indians to their homelands, Indian people were coerced into signing treaties that	relinquished their titles to lands. In response to pressure from settlers for	additional land, Congress passed the Removal Bill in 1830, giving President Andrew	Jackson the power to exchange land west of the Mississippi River for Indian	homelands in the Southeast. The western land was loosely described as &quot;an ample	district west of the Mississippi, not within the states of Missouri and Louisiana	or the territory of Arkansas.&quot; Those Indian people who voluntarily agree to the	exchange were relocated in an area of present&#45;day Oklahoma. Those who refused were	forcibly removed. The Native people were to be guaranteed rights to the new land	forever in exchange for their homelands.</P><P>The Regulation Act of 1834 prohibited non&#45;Indians from settling in Indian lands and	required them to have license to trade with Native Americans, but waves of white settlers	continued to move west across the Mississippi River anyway. Once territories were	established in Iowa and Wisconsin, it became necessary to move the Indian &quot;frontier&quot;	from the Mississippi River to the 95th meridian. The new line extended from the Lake	of the Woods near the Minnesota&#45;Canada border, south through Minnesota and Iowa, along	the western border of Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana into Texas. Military forts like	Fort Snelling were established to maintain this frontier. (In 1858, Minnesota was made	a state. It extended west of the 95th meridian, 100 miles beyond the &quot;permanent frontier&quot;	of the American Indians.)</P><P align="left"><B>The Conquest of the West</B>	<BR>The discovery of gold in California in 1848 precipitated another wave of migration along	the Santa Fe and Oregon trails. Settlers and miners overran Indian lands, obliterating	their villages. Through a combination of disease and genocide, an estimated 70,000	Native people died in the west in the decade between 1849 and 1859.<BR><BR>By the outbreak of the Civil War, thirty million Euro&#45;Americans populated the country	to the east of the Mississippi and along the West Coast. A sizeable population of Africans	brought into this country as a result of the slave trade also lived to the east. Although	the war had temporarily slowed the movement of settlers from the east to the west, it was	renewed with even greater force at the war's end. The decades from 1860 to 1890 that gave	rise to the Wild West legends of cowboys, range wars, cattle drives, and homesteaders were	sadly the same time that American Indian people faced the final conquest of their lands.</P><P>		<SPAN class="link">More about <A href="history_culture6.html">Native American History and Culture</A></SPAN>		<BR>		<BR>		<BR></P></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD>&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">	<TR>		<TD colspan="3" valign="top" height="1" background="images/black_dot.gif">		<IMG src="images/black_dot.gif"></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD width="90" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsmia.org">		<IMG src="images/logo.gif" width="90" height="60" alt="MIA Home Page" align="middle" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD width="160" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsconnected.org">		<IMG src="images/logo_aceonly.gif" width="160" height="25" alt="ArtsConnectEd" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD valign="top" align="right" width="504"><A href="print_curriculum.html"><IMG src="images/printable.gif" width="185" height="19" alt="Printable Curriculum" border="0"></A></TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
