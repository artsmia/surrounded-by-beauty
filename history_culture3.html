Largely unknown to many non&#45;Indians, the	stories of American Indians are as rich as the mythology of the ancient Greeks.	They explain the nature of creation and the universe, serve as a model of human	behavior, and transmit history and tradition. Storytellers who were usually older	members of the community, often grandparents, handed down these stories. In some	instances, the stories are an integral part of works of art, communicating	visually the rich cultural heritage of Native American people.</P><P><B>History</B>		<BR>Too often in the past the history of America has been written as if it began with	the arrival of the Europeans. This attitude excludes the long heritage of Native	people who have lived in North America for tens of thousands of years (to traditional	people, since the &quot;beginning of time&quot;). Five hundred years ago at the point of initial	contact with Europeans millions of culturally diverse people speaking hundreds of	different languages populated North America. The environments in which they lived	shaped their lifestyles. Depending on the resources available to them, some were	farmers or gatherers, others fished and hunted. Many	<A href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('g_tribe.html','glossary','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=300,height=250'); return false">tribes</A>	lived in one place most	of the time, while others were	<A href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('g_nomad.html','glossary','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=300,height=250'); return false">nomadic</A>	hunters following the migratory patterns of	large game animals, such as buffalo.</P><P>These different economies gave rise to diverse cultural characteristics and complex	social, political, and economic systems. In the northeast	<A href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('g_woodlands.html','glossary','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=300,height=250'); return false">Woodlands</A>	region, six	nations formed the Iroquois Confederacy, aspects of which served as a model for the	makers of the U.S. Constitution. Highly complex agricultural societies existed in the	<A href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('g_southwest.html','glossary','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=300,height=250'); return false">Southwest</A>	and Midwest for centuries prior to the arrival of the Europeans. In the	Southwest, Native people developed irrigation systems that exist today, some still in	use. Vast trade routes distributed everything from shells to fabric among the many	cultures that populated the North American continent.</P><P><B>Why &quot;Indians&quot;?</B>		<BR>Despite the five centuries that have elapsed since Native people and early explorers	came into contact, the history and culture of Native people remains unknown or	misunderstood by many non&#45;Indian people. The misunderstanding began early. Christopher	Columbus set out to explore Japan, Korea, China, and India, which were collectively	referred to at the time as the East Indies. Believing that he had arrived in the	Indies when he reached the lands of the New World, Columbus mistakenly called the	Native people &quot;Indians&quot;. This term has prevailed into the 20th century. Today, most	North American Natives prefer to be called Native American or American Indian,	although the majority of Native people originally referred to themselves in their	own languages by words meaning &quot;the people.&quot; For example the	Ojibwe people, often referred to as Chippewa by non&#45;Indians, call themselves	&quot;Anishinabe&quot; which is the Ojibwe word for &quot;the people.&quot;</P><P>		<SPAN class="link">More about <A href="history_culture4.html">Native American History and Culture</A></SPAN>		<BR>		<BR>		<BR></P></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD>&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">	<TR>		<TD colspan="3" valign="top" height="1" background="images/black_dot.gif">		<IMG src="images/black_dot.gif"></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD width="90" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsmia.org">		<IMG src="images/logo.gif" width="90" height="60" alt="MIA Home Page" align="middle" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD width="160" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsconnected.org">		<IMG src="images/logo_aceonly.gif" width="160" height="25" alt="ArtsConnectEd" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD valign="top" align="right" width="504"><A href="print_curriculum.html"><IMG src="images/printable.gif" width="185" height="19" alt="Printable Curriculum" border="0"></A></TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
