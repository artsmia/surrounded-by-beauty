However, many reservations	created after the Civil War were little more than prison camps. The reservation	lands were often unproductive and rations given to people were inadequate, so many	died of starvation and disease. Some reservations required that Indians apply for	permits to leave the reservation. To discourage Native people from retaining their	own cultures, reservation officials denied them the right to speak their own	languages or to practice their most sacred ceremonies. Native American children were	often taken from their families and placed in boarding schools against their parents'	wishes. Once removed from their own traditions, the children were more likely to	become	<A href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('g_assimilation.html','glossary','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=300,height=250'); return false">assimilated</A>	into white culture.</P><P><B>Allotment of Land</B>		<BR>Government policy towards Indian land changed from tribal ownership of reservation	land to individual ownership of lots of land with the passage of the Dawes Allotment	Act in 1887. The Act was implemented to give each American Indian a plot of land with	the intention of teaching them to farm and hasten assimilation of Native people into	the Euro&#45;American culture. In order for the individual allotments to be made, Native	people had to surrender their reservation lands to the government. After the government	allotted 169 acres to each adult and 80 acres to each child, the rest of the reservation	land was offered for sale to non&#45;Indians. Of the 138 million acres of land in Indian	possession at the onset of the Dawes Act, only 48 million acres remained in Indian hands	by 1932. Today, only 2 percent of the land of the 48 contiguous states belong to American	Indians. The people of the Red Lake Reservation in Minnesota take great pride in the fact	that they never surrendered their land for allotment. Today their reservation is among	the few lands in America never owned by Euro&#45;Americans.</P>			<TABLE width="275" border="0" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="6" align="right">				<TR>					<TD valign="top" align="left">					<IMG src="images/contemp_americans.jpg" title="contemp_americans" width="275" height="215" align="top" alt="Photo of contemporary Native Americans" hspace="0" vspace="4"><BR>					<B class="caption">Native American children today share the interests of all American					children as well as interest in their own cultural traditions.

Despite tremendous obstacles, Native Americans		have survived. Although their population was decimated, they have recovered. In 1917, for		the first time since the arrival of Europeans on this continent, more Native Americans		were born than died. Today approximately 2,500,000 Native Americans live in the United		States. And, the world they live in is changing. Native Americans are renewing their own		pride in their traditions. Education has enabled the Native people to benefit themselves		and to accomplish much in the outside world. Today, many American Indian people regard themselves as		nations within a nation, governed by their own tribal governments. They have hope for the future.</P><P><SPAN class="link">More about <A href="history_culture8.html">Native American History and Culture</A></SPAN>		<BR>		<BR>		<BR></P></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD>&nbsp;</TD>	</TR></TABLE><TABLE width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">	<TR>		<TD colspan="3" valign="top" height="1" background="images/black_dot.gif">		<IMG src="images/black_dot.gif"></TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD width="90" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsmia.org">		<IMG src="images/logo.gif" width="90" height="60" alt="MIA Home Page" align="middle" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD width="160" valign="middle" align="left">		<A href="http://www.artsconnected.org">		<IMG src="images/logo_aceonly.gif" width="160" height="25" alt="ArtsConnectEd" border="0"></A></TD>		<TD valign="top" align="right" width="504"><A href="print_curriculum.html"><IMG src="images/printable.gif" width="185" height="19" alt="Printable Curriculum" border="0"></A></TD>	</TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
