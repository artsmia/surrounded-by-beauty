These people were farmers, settled into one area.         Since pottery is heavy to move and breaks easily, it is not usually made         by people who move around a lot. </p>      <p>Pottery has been excavated from some of the earthen mounds. This clay         jar was unearthed in present-day Arkansas. It was hand-made using the         coiling technique. The coils of clay were wound around to build up the         sides of the jar and then pinched together and smoothed. The design was         made by scratching lines into the wet clay after the pot was formed, then         the pot was fired to harden the clay. <br>        &nbsp; </p>    </td>    <td width="25">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td colspan="3" valign="top" height="1" background="images/black_dot.gif"><img src="images/black_dot.gif"></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="351" valign="middle" align="left"><img src="images/logo.gif" width="90" height="60" alt="MIA Home Page" align="middle">       <img src="images/logo_aceonly.gif" width="160" height="25" alt="ArtsConnectEd"></td>    <td valign="top" align="right" width="383"><img src="images/printable.gif" width="185" height="19" alt="Printable Curriculum"></td>    <td valign="top" align="right" width="25">&nbsp;</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
