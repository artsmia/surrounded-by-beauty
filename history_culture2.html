Access to this spiritual world is gained	through dreams, visions, and ceremonies. Many Native people also believe in	a single creative force. The name for this spiritual force varies from one	group to another: it is called orenda (Or&#45;END&#45;a) by the Iroquois, manitou	(MAN&#45;e&#45;too) by the Algonquin, and	<A href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('g_wakan.html','glossary','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=300,height=250'); return false">wakan</A>	(wah&#45;KON) by the	<A href="#" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('g_lakota.html','glossary','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=no,width=300,height=250'); return false">Lakota</A>.</P><P>Historically, Native Americans' lives were shaped by their spiritual beliefs.	Most Native people believed that they were connected to every other element of	creation. Each animal, tree, or rock had its own spirit through which an individual	could establish contact with the spirit world. The survival and well&#45;being of	Native people was dependent on maintaining harmony with the earth. Many	contemporary Native people continue to hold these traditional beliefs.</P><P><B>Warfare</B>		<BR>Although American Indian people engaged in warfare before European contact, as	well as later in defense of their homelands, the image of the Native people as	savage warriors has been grossly exaggerated. Native people who did engage in	warfare were no more or less savage than other societies of the period. Although	scalping has often been associated with Indian warfare, Europeans may have introduced	it on this continent. Europeans certainly encouraged scalping, supplying metal	scalping knives to replace flint or horn tools and offering bounties in the 18th	century for the scalps of Indian men, women and children.</P><P>North American Indians did not have armies, but some Native cultures had military	societies. Many Native people engaged in sporadic warfare with their neighbors for	purposes of self&#45;protection or acquiring resources, for revenge, but mainly for honor.	In many societies, a man gained honor in battle.
